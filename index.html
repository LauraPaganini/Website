					<h3>3D Data Visualization</h3>
					<p>This project was a research experiment to investigate the effectiveness of augmented reality and interactive data visualization.
						I wrote C# scripts within Unity to translate data points into a 3D graph. I also created clickable buttons within the
						scene that changed the data set and applied filters. I then configured it to work with the Microsoft Hololens, which
						required changing the project to fit the Universal Windows Platform specifications.</p>

					<h3>"Net Nonny" Proxy</h3>
					<p>For my Networking class at Miami University, I wrote a Python proxy server that acted like the "Net Nanny" product.
						The proxy filters web pages' URLs and text content and redirects to an error page when it detects inappropriate content.
						This proxy uses socket programming and supports TCP protocol.</p>

					<h3>Tableau Dashboard</h3>
					<p>Through the Agile Launchpad program at Miami, I lead a small team of developers in the creation of a Tableau Dashboard
						for Suncorp Insurance. The three-month project worked in weekly sprints, and we would meet with the customers with
						an updated prototype at the end of each sprint. I regulated tasks for my team and ensured that all features where completed
						on time and true to specifications.</p>

							Miami University's cirriculum is heavily Java-oriented. Through working as a Teaching Assistant for three semesters of Java-based
							classes, I have the most experience in Java. All of the data structure implementation, assignments, and labs were
							in Java. To test assignments, I would write a thorough JUnit tester and run each student's assignment against this
							tester.
						</div>
						<div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-csharp" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-csharp-list">
							I learned C# on-the-job at my internship with Progressive Insurance. The majority of my work was in C# in an MVC application
							to generate responsive, powerful website features that is cohesive with the rest of their solution. I also created
							C# scripts within Unity to add user interaction and dynamic data representation in the 3D data visualization research
							project.
						</div>
						<div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-javascript" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-javascript-list">
							At Progressive Insurance, I also added client-side features such as data validation, dynamic features, and user interaction
							using Javascript. I have the most experience in the JQuery framework, as well as generating and sending data in JSON
							objects with AJAX requests.
						</div>
						<div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-python" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-python-list">
							Python is my favorite scripting language. I used Python to automate testing as a Teaching Assistant, which included managing
							~60 seperate Git repositories. I also wrote scripts to create a rendering pipeline for my 3D animation projects, which
							required working within Autodesk Maya's scripting capacities.
						</div>
						<div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-sql" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-sql-list">
							At Progressive Insurance, I created and updated relational database tables using stored procedures. I cleaned data from the
							JSON objects, ran transcations to the database, and populated website fields based on information retrieved from outside
							databases.
						</div>
						<div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-agile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-agile-list">
							I perform best in an agile environment. I have experience in developing a real-world application with customer input through
							the Agile Launchpad program, where we developed a Tableau dashboard for Suncorp Insurance. I was the interface between
							the team of developers and the customers and worked to interpret feedback into manageable tasks, as well as keeping
							the project on track.

						<h4>Progressive Insurance

						<p>Developed C# web applications for Progressive's independent agents. I added functionality to the new agent registration
							form by implementing the front-end user interface as well as the database interactions. In addition, I converted ASP.NET
							pages to more modular, maintainable Model-View-Controller objects. In collaboration with other interns, I wrote a
							3D data visualization framework for the Microsoft Hololens.</p>
